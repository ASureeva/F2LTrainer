# F2LTrainer

https://dave2ooo.github.io/F2LTrainer/

This [F2L Trainer](https://dave2ooo.github.io/F2LTrainer/) was created to help you find and practice a variety of different F2L cases. You can find not only the basic 41 F2L cases but also the cases to be solved in the back and cases where the F2L pieces are in a different F2L slot.
